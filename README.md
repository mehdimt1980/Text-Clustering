Text Clustering with K-Means

This project uses the K-Means algorithm to cluster the text of Hobbes's Leviathan into a specified number of clusters. The text is downloaded from the Project Gutenberg website: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3207 and preprocessed to remove stopwords, punctuation, and other non-textual elements. The resulting text data is then transformed using a bag-of-words model and clustered using K-Means with the scikit-learn library. The resulting clusters are visualized using a scatter plot.
